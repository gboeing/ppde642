# About Git

Git is a [version control system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).

Git Does:

- take snapshots of your project (on command, with descriptions)
- allow you to check out any snapshot at any time
- show you the difference between snapshots
- search your project's history
- allow parallel, isolated developments (and then merge them)
- detect conflicting changes
- send your project and all its history to a server (like GitHub)

Git Does Not:

- track every single little change
- save you from talking to your colleagues

# Today

Today we'll be working on the [Git lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
from [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/).
We won't be covering all of it so feel free to work through the rest
on your own.
