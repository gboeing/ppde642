Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2014

Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. See
Geographic Terms and Definitions at 
http://www.census.gov/popest/about/geo/terms.html for a list of the states that are
included in each region and division. All geographic boundaries for the 2014 population
estimates series except statistical area delineations are as of January 1, 2014. The
Office of Management and Budget's statistical area delineations for metropolitan,
micropolitan, and combined statistical areas, as well as metropolitan divisions, are those
issued by that agency in February 2013 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf. An
"(X)" in the 2010 Census field indicates a locality that was formed or incorporated after the
2010 Census. Additional information on these localities can be found in the Geographic Boundary Change Notes (see 
http://www.census.gov/geo/reference/boundary-changes.html).  For
