# Assignment 1: Project proposal

See syllabus for due date.

This course's final project requires you to prepare a conference paper. For this assignment, you will pick a conference and develop a project proposal to think through your research question and data. This can be tweaked somewhat as the semester goes on, if needed, but for now I want you to have a working research question. If you are asking about "cause," "effect," or "influence," you need a causal research design. Note that a causal research question is not required for this course, so do not ask one unless you are already comfortable working within a causal inference framework. Next, identify and download candidate datasets that will help you answer your question. At least one of your datasets must have a spatial component (such as latitude-longitude points, or building footprints, or census tracts, or anything else explicitly spatial).

Write a 2-3 page paper (single-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman font) that does the following. First, explain your research topic, its context, its importance, and your target conference (~1/2 page). Second, state your research question and provide a brief literature review of relevant research around this topic to explain what is currently known and what remains an open question (~1 page). Third, document the datasets you have downloaded, including 1) the data sources; 2) the data contents such as variables, descriptions, and units of analysis; 3) how you might analyze these data to answer your research question (~1 page). Ensure your submission is <4 pages total, everything included.

Submit this paper as a PDF via Blackboard.
