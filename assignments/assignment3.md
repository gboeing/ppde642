# Assignment 3: Network analysis

See syllabus for due date.

You will model and analyze a spatial network. Ideally this will support your research question but if you cannot connect this assignment to your question, then consider this a standalone piece of work.

Create a new Jupyter notebook. Use OSMnx to download and model the street networks of at least 3 different places. Then calculate network stats and visualize interesting aspects of the networks. How do they compare and contrast with each other? What does that tell you? Then use pandana to conduct an accessibility analysis on each place. Make sure your code is well-commented throughout for explanatory clarity. Your notebook should conclude with a markdown cell that succinctly explains what you are analyzing and visualizing and why it is interesting. What story does it tell? How does it relate to the "big picture"?

This assignment is left as open-ended as possible to give you maximum flexibility to explore widely and find synergy with your final project. You will be graded on creativity and analytical quality.

Make sure your notebook runs from the top without any errors (i.e., restart the kernel and run all cells) and that all the visuals can be seen inline without me having to re-run your notebook. Via Blackboard, submit your notebook and data files (if any), all zipped as a single file, named `LastName_FirstName_Assignment3.zip`. If your submission file exceeds Blackboard's maximum upload size limit, you may provide a Google Drive link to your zipped data in the comment field when you submit.
