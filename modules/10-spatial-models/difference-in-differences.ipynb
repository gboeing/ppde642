    "# Difference-in-differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference-in-differences (DiD) is a quasi-experimental statistical method common in econometrics that uses data from an observational study to approximate a natural experiment with treatment/control groups and observations before and after some \"treatment\" of interest. It estimates the *effect* of a predictor (the treatment) on the response. DiD can help mitigate selection biases but could still suffer from endogeneity problems like a confounding omitted variable or simultaneity. The usual OLS assumptions apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example assumes you have 80 census tracts: 40 in a control group and 40 in a treatment group. A new policy was implemented in the treatment group in 2017 and we want to test its effect on rents. For each tract, we have median rent/sqft at two time points: pre-treatment (2014) and post-treatment (2020). We assign randomized values to generate data accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not control for spatial diffusion of the policy effect in this example: after working through the example, set up the DiD with controls for spatial diffusion as individual exercise."
