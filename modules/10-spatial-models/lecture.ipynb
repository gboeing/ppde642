    "\n",
    "Overview of today's topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - quick refresher\n",
    "  - spatial fixed effects\n",
    "  - spatial regimes\n",
    "  - spatial lag\n",
    "  - spatial error\n",
    "  - geographically-weighted regression\n",
    "  \n",
    "## 1. Quick refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Theory and models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial models** are models that include geographic information to account for spatial relationships and processes. They can take on many different forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Spatially-explicit regression models (with [PySAL](https://pysal.org))\n",
    "  - Agent-based models and/or cellular automata (with [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/))\n",
    "  - Bayesian spatial models using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (with [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/))\n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on spatially-explicit regression models here. Spatially-explicit regression models are a type of **statistical model**: sets of assumptions plus mathematical relationships between variables, producing a formal representation of some theory. We are essentially trying to explain the process underlying the generation of our observed data. **Spatial inference** introduces explicit spatial relationships into the statistical modeling framework, as both theory-driven (e.g., spatial spillovers) and data-driven (e.g., MAUP) issues could otherwise violate modeling assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Statistical inference refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical inference** is the process of using a sample to *infer* the characteristics of an underlying population (from which this sample was drawn) through estimation and hypothesis testing. What is the probability distribution (the probabilities of occurrence of different possible outcome values of our response variable)? Contrast this with descriptive statistics, which focus simply on describing the characteristics of the sample itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common goals of inferential statistics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - parameter estimation and confidence intervals\n",
    "  - hypothesis rejection\n",
    "  - prediction and explanation\n",
    "  - model selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Schools of statistical inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - frequentist\n",
    "    - frequentists think of probability as proportion of time some outcome occurs (relative frequency)\n",
    "    - given lots of repeated trials, how likely is the observed outcome?\n",
    "    - concepts: statistical hypothesis testing, *p*-values, confidence intervals\n",
    "  - bayesian\n",
    "    - bayesians think of probability as amount of certainty observer has about an outcome occurring (subjective probability)\n",
    "    - probability as a measure of how much info the observer has about the real world, updated as info changes\n",
    "    - concepts: prior probability, likelihood, bayes' rule, posterior probability\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 1.3. Regression refresher\n",
    "\n",
    "This course presumes you're already comfortable with multiple regression and OLS, as a prerequisite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - an additive, linear relationship between response and predictors\n",
    "  - uncorrelated predictors\n",
    "  - uncorrelated, homoskedastic, normally-distributed errors\n",
    "  \n",
    "Regression topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - specification: choosing variables to include and the functional form\n",
    "  - transformation: pre-processing to improve linear fit (log, power, etc) and feature scaling\n",
    "  - estimation: using an algorithm (such as OLS, WLS, MLE, etc) to estimate (aka, fit or train) your model's parameters\n",
    "  - validation and diagnostics: model's goodness of fit ($R^2$), parameters' statistical significance ($t$-test and $p$-values), check errors and assumptions (diagnostic tests, residual plot, Q-Q plot, etc), outlier influence (leverage), robustness checks (alternative specifications)\n",
    "  - resampling: cross-validation (out-of-sample prediction with train/test subsets) and bootstrapping (random subsampling to generate estimates' distribution)\n",
    "  - model selection and regularization: bias-variance tradeoff (over/under-fitting), lasso (L1 regularization), ridge (L2 regularization), hyperparameters\n",

    "## 5. Geographically weighted regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with global regression models is that they are essentially spatial averages, obfuscating all the local variation in the process you're exploring. GWR allows us to investigate how model parameters and performance vary across the study area. It calibrates a regression model on each observation's local neighborhood then combines these into a global model for the study area. A user-defined *bandwidth* determines how these local models are calibrated: GWR estimates a model for each observation, using all the other observations weighted by their inverse-distance to that observation. The weighting is determined by fitting a *spatial kernel* to the data parameterized by the bandwidth distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accordingly, the combination of bandwidth and kernel affects the smoothing (i.e., over-/under-fitting) of your model. Common kernels include the gaussian and bisquare. Bandwidth can be fixed or adaptive. If fixed, then the same distance is used for weighting across every observation's local neighborhood. However, this can introduce problems if your observations vary in density. Consider tracts: a tract in downtown LA may have 100 other tracts within 20km of it, but a tract in the Antelope Valley may have only 2 or 3 (too few for precise estimation). An adaptive bandwidth instead uses a fixed number of nearest neighbors to adjust the bandwidth distance accordingly: tracts in dense areas get a narrower bandwidth distance and tracts in sparse areas get a wider one. For more on GWR, [this book](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Geographically+Weighted+Regression%3A+The+Analysis+of+Spatially+Varying+Relationships+-p-9780470855256) offers a good gentle introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to specify fixed vs adaptive bandwidth ([adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_kernel_density_estimation)), spatial kernel ([gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)#Kernel_functions_in_common_use)), optimization technique ([golden section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden-section_search)), and a criterion to minimize ([AICc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion#AICc))."
