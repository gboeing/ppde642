    "\n",
    "**Probability** is the ratio of an event occuring to all possible events occurring, whereas the **odds** are the ratio of an event occuring to it not occurring. That is, the odds are the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring: $\\text{odds}=\\frac{p}{1-p}$ and conversely $p=\\frac{\\text{odds}}{1 + \\text{odds}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there are 8 blue marbles and 2 red marbles in an urn, the probability of drawing a blue marble is $\\frac{8}{8+2}=0.8$, its odds are $\\frac{8}{2}=4$ (often expressed 4:1) which is equivalent to $\\frac{0.8}{1-0.8}=4$, and its log-odds are therefore $\\log(4)=1.386$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Log-odds** (the logarithm of the odds) are useful because they take odds that are asymmetrically distributed around 1 and transform them symmetrically around 0, such that $\\log(4)=-\\log(\\frac{1}{4})$, and allow us to linearly combine **odds ratios** by simply adding and subtracting (because the log of a ratio is the log of the numerator minus the log of the denominator). In other words, the *odds* are the ratio of two probabilities, and an *odds ratio* is the ratio of two odds: useful when comparing the odds of a \"what if\" scenario to the odds of the base scenario, as we will see."

    "Logistic regression is a regression analysis technique used when the response is binary. Logistic regression is a classification method, but it uses the general linear model and the same formula as linear regression, and it generates a continuous probability value before converting it to a classification prediction. Logistic regression uses maximum likelihood estimation (with regularization by default in scikit-learn) to estimate the parameters of a logit model. It maximizes the (log) [likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function) function, equivalent to minimizing the cost function via gradient descent.\n",

A **decision tree** is a nonparametric model that partitions the feature space into boxes. It has a tendency to overfit data, but ensembles can help prevent it from getting stuck in a local minimum. Ensemble techniques, which build many individual models then combine them, can be broadly divided into bagging and boosting methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - bagging: train many models on different random bootstrap (ie, with replacement) samples of the data then average them (\"bootstrap aggregating\")\n",
    "  - boosting: build ensemble incrementally by empasizing the previously misclassified data points as you train each new model\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random forest** is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees then uses bagging. This helps correct for decision trees' overfitting the training data. Random forests tend to work well out of the box, handle nonlinearity well, and work well in very high dimension spaces. Note we don't have to standardize the data to train a decision tree or random forest."

In other words, SVM finds the hyperplane that maximizes the distance between it and the nearest data point on either side of it.
