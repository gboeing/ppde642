    "Dimensionality reduction lets us reduce the number of features (variables) in our data set with minimal loss of information. This data compression is called **feature extraction**. Feature extraction is similar to feature selection in that they both reduce the total number of variables in your analysis. In feature selection, we use domain theory or an algorithm to select important variables for our model. Feature extraction instead projects your features onto a lower-dimension space, creating new features rather than just selecting a subset of existing ones.\n",

PCA is very similar to exploratory factor analysis, and is often referred to as a type of factor analysis. The former is used to discover relationships in the data, whereas the latter usually implies that you are probing a theoretical (latent) relationship among your variables. We'll focus on PCA today.\n",

    "PCA is used 1) to fix multicollinearity problems and 2) for dimensionality reduction. In the former, it converts a set of original, correlated features into a new set of orthogonal features, which is useful in regression and cluster analysis. In the latter, it summarizes a set of original, correlated features with a smaller number of features that still explain most of the variance in your data (data compression).\n",

    "PCA identifies the combinations of features (directions in feature space) that account for the most variance in the dataset. These orthogonal axes of maximum variance are called principal components. A **principal component** is an eigenvector (direction of maximum variance) of the features' covariance matrix, and the corresponding eigenvalue is its magnitude (factor by which it is \"stretched\"). An eigenvector is the cosine of the angle between a feature and a component. Its corresponding eigenvalue represents the share of variance it accounts for. PCA takes your (standardized) features' covariance matrix, decomposes it into its eigenvectors/eigenvalues, sorts them by eigenvalue magnitude, constructs a projection matrix $W_k$ from the corresponding top $k$ eigenvectors, then transforms the features using the projection matrix to get the new $k$-dimensional feature subspace. Always standardize your data before PCA because it is sensitive to features' scale.\n",

The $\\epsilon$ parameter represents the maximum distance in the feature space that points can be from each other to be considered a cluster. The min_samples parameter is the minimum cluster size allowed: everything else gets classified as noise.\n",
